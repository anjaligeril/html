		<h3> Goals</h3>
		<p>Personal development is essential for success and as such you need to identify goals that fall under this category. These could be improving your communication or leadership skills and developing conflict management and strategic contribution skills at work.  These skills are just as important as vocational competencies, and they can help professionals develop short-term goals that will lead them to achieving their long term ones.</p>
	<p>Being productive at work can help you maintain your job and as such, identifying objectives that will help you focus on your productivity is an important first step for all professionals. Productivity goals refer to your ability to produce results that are determined by your employer in a specific time-frame that may be imposed by the client or the employer.</p>
